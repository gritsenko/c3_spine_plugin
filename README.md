### Please support development of the C3 Spine plugin (thanks to all those kind folks who have donated so far!)

- Commisions for specific new features are also accepted, contact Mikal via Twitter @kindeyegames or the Construct Community Discord server (Mikal).

## Important notes for Spine export files:
- Requires Spine version 3.8.x or 4.0.x Spine JSON files. 
- Not compatible with 3.8.75 spine (due to spine-ts runtime issues), use a later 3.8.x version or 4.0 version.
- Spine 4.0.x JSON files require beta 2.x.x C3 addon version.
- Spine 3.8.x JSON files require 1.x.x C3 addon version.
- When exporting from Spine 4.9 for beta 2.x.x  use 4.x.x export format.
- When exporting from Spine 4.0 for 1.x.x C3 addon export using 3.8 JSON format and in Texture Packer Settings, check Options->Legacy output.
- See Spine Formatter below to upgrade older JSON files.
- In the Spine export dialogue box, under Runtime, set both 'Filter min' and 'Filter mag' to Linear or Nearest.
- In the Packing settings, set Region Padding to 2 or higher (if you see lines around your images, it may be because padding is set to 0).
- Max texture size, 4096x4096. multiple texture sheets supported (use comma separated list on C3 spine object's png path property).

## Additional Spine project guidelines:
- Do not use minify on export of C3 project.
- Worker mode supported for C3.
- For jumping or large movments, animate Spine character 'in place', don't do large translations in the Spine project.
- Use C3 events and movement to do the large translations in the C3 project instead (e.g. a long jump.)
- If animation is clipping against the bounds of the C3 object, you can use the property bbox override and values to control the bounding box size and center offset. The values are based on Spine project coordinates.
- Alternatively create a large transparent image in the Spine project behind your Spine character, this will can be used to set the bounding box size fot the C3 spine render.

## Multiple instances of a C3 Spine Object
- Each C3 Spine Object (not instance), should load only one skeleton and only one atlas.
- Other instances of the Spine Object must use the same skeleton and atlas, but can use different skins.
- This new change reduces the size of the texture memory required for multiple instances of the same skeleton.

## Set region action
- This action changes the current region texture on the skeleton/slot/placeholder of the current skin of the skeleton to a new region in the loaded atlas. All other instances of the same skeleton/skin will also change. This can be useful for customizing skins. Using skins is the typical way to do this.

## Custom skins
- Runtime skins can be created, using *Create custom skin*, *Add custom skin* and *Set custom skin*.

## Slot color/dark color
- Slot color can be set through *Set slot color* and *Set slot dark color*. The colors are applied using *Apply slot colors*. The slot colors will be reverted if a new skin is applied or if the Spine animation changes the slot colors. To reset the slot colors to the original colors, use *Reset slot colors*. Dark color will only be applied if 'Tint Black' is enabled for the slot in the Spine project.

## Render quality
- This sets the resolution of the texture to render to. Lower quality requres less texture memory and GPU performance.

## Bounding Box Attachment
- SpineBBoxCenterX, SpineBBoxCenterY espressions give the average of the named slot/bbox polygon points. Useful for attaching C3 Sprite object / collision box to the center of the Bounding Box.
- The UpdateBBoxes updates the bounding box to the current point in the animation. It should be done just once per tick per instance, before the SpineBBoxCenterX/Y expressions are used.
- SpineBBoxGetPoly expression returns poly points in JSON format array of named slot/bounding box attachment. Use C3 JSON object to parse and use points. The points are returned in top level JSON array [x0,y0, x1, y1,...]
- [Spine Bounding Box Attachment Documentation](http://en.esotericsoftware.com/spine-bounding-boxes)

## Bone control ACEs
- ACEs to override properties of bones (x,y,rotation, scale x, scale y), these are applied prior to IK transformation, but are useful for controlling 'endpoints' of IK, for example with an aim / crosshair bone.

## Render quality ACE
- Controls Spine render resolution
- Only apply to one Spine instance per Spine object (e.g. use pick top instance).
- Wait 0.1S after applying (caution for race condition, reviewing need.)
- After done, destroy all Spine instance and then recreate as needed with the new render quality.

## Share your C3 and Spine plugin work!
- Tweet your work @kindeyegames , @pix2d and #construct3, we'd be happy to see your work!

## Debugging issues
- Make sure all file names are lowercase, including on export from Spine (the png file names are embedded into the atlas data also)
- Check that file names in property match project file names
- Check that animation names include animation 'folder' name also if you use folders for animations.
- If only one skeleton, leave skeleton property blank.
- Check the debug property, during runtime, open the dev console window and check for errors or warnings.

## Known issues / workarounds
- Clipping on rendering, consider using bbxo override to set the render area and centering.
- Animation finished with animation mix causing another finished trigger see [issue](https://github.com/gritsenko/c3_spine_plugin/issues/44) for workaround.
- No render of default skin w/ no bones assigned, instead assign default skin bones.

[Spine Formatter](https://gritsenko.github.io/c3_spine_plugin/formatter/index.html)

## Current supported features
- Load Spine json, atlas and pngs.
- Select starting skin, skeleton, animation

- Add expressions TextureWidth, TextureHeight (texture size used to display Spine), based on original Spine bounds and RenderQuality setting.
- Multiple skeleton instances (w/ variable skin) per Spine object (save on atlas texture memory usage and faster to spawn new instances.)
- Batch render for improved performance with multiple Spine instances and objects.
